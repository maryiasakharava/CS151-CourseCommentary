Problem/issue to resolve:

Many SJSU students rely on Rate my Professors when registering for classes in order to gain more information on the professors and courses they will take in the upcoming semester. However, students can run into issues when professors are not announced at the time of registration, or there is turnover of the faculty teaching a specific course. In these circumstances, they might not know where to look in order to receive more student-based information about the courses they plan to take. The solution we propose, Course Commentary, is a review system that is organized by course rather than professor. Since courses are more constant factors than professors teaching the course, students will always be able to access information about the courses they plan to take, giving them insight on how their next semester will go. 

Survey previous works (maybe): 

https://www.ratemycourses.io/sjsu An existing solution to the issue is a website called Rate my Courses for SJSU. There are some issues with it that our website would resolve. For one thing, this website is not very updated, so many courses have no information. We would try to provide a course description for every class so at least some information is available for everything. Next, the website’s review system still links to a professor. This leads to the issue of professor turnover or lack of professor information at registration time. In our solution, the review template provided by the website would be more course specific, so it would ask questions about course content, resources used to study, and helpful tips for the course. Users can also provide information about their majors and whether this course was required, elective, or GE in their review, along with a professor rating out of 5 stars. The professor rankings will be display within the course, so students can see both the course reviews and the rankings of professors. 

Assumptions/operating environments/intended usage:

The website is designed for SJSU students who are looking to register for classes, however, they want to learn more about the course from the previous student before they register. Users will be able to access this website from any browser. Students will be able to use this site to aid them in their search for information about the courses that they are taking or about to take.

Description of solution:

A website similar to Rate my Professor, however, it will be organized by course. Within the courses, students can see professors teaching it and ratings; the organization will be based on course, so it is easier to access and make changes. Students will be able to post the reviews about the courses they have already taken, and read the reviews for the courses they are planning to register for. They can delete reviews if they post by mistake or want to change their review. On the post the information you can enter will be as follows: Professor taken, Course, School, Description of course, Grade Earned when taking course, Level of difficulty, and Textbook required. The date of posting and user’s major will also be included in the post.

Functionality:

Our solution tackles the issue of inconsistent or missing information at the time of registration. Rate my professor is a solution which provides professor specific information, but professors are not always known at registration time, or the professor’s review for a specific course is not always provided. By organizing reviews by course, students will always have access to information about courses they need to take, regardless of variable factors such as the professor teaching the course, whether the course is required, the difficulty of the course, and so on. This is also a more organized structure, because students can look at their myPlanner and then go to the website to read reviews about courses they are planning to enroll in. Not only will this provide more organization and information, but it will also make their decision about what courses to take easier.
